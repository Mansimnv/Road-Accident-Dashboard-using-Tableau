# Road-Accident-Dashboard-using-Tableau

I have designed a tableau dashboard to analyze road accident data. The dashboard visually depicts accidents, casualties, severity of a accident, type of vehicle, road surface, weather condition that causes casualties overtime across different locations.
Using interactive maps and charts users can explore patterns, identify high risk areas and gain insights into contributing factors. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview, enabling stakeholders to make data driven decisions for road safety initiatives.
